# Simon game
A re-creation of the popular 1970s and 1980s memory skill game.

## How to Play
Click the on/off button to power up the game. When you are ready click the Start button. The game will light up one button, which
also plays a sound. The player should repeat what the game plays. As the game progresses it will produce a pattern of button presses,
with each level having an increasing number of buttons to be pressed. Reach level 20 to win!

If you get so good that the game becomes too easy to win, try 'Strict' mode which will reset you to level zero if you get any of the
patterns wrong.
